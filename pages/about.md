## About Me

I'm a Chinese male who was born in the 1970s.
I'm 4 feet 7 inches tall and I weigh 324 pounds.

At the end of the last century, I studied at a secondary vocational school in Xiamen, China.
I majored in tourism management, but I didn't graduate since the mathematics is too difficult for me.
Also, both Chinese and English are hard for me too, and I can't write or read well.

At the beginning of this century, I was married to a woman.
This marriage lasted for 13 years, then we divorced.
I once had two kids, but my ex-wife took them away, since I can't afford alimony.

Now, I'm living with my parents.
So I hope my next spouse has her own house in the downtown areas.

## Profile

I'm working as a night shift doorman for [Cryptape Co., Ltd], since April 2017, in Hangzhou, China.

I have been engaged as a night shift doorman for more than twenty years.

I'm good at work as a night shift doorman.

**I am honest, and I never lie.**
