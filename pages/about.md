## About Me

I'm a Chinese male, who was born in the 1970s.

I'm 4 feet 7 inches tall and I weigh 324 pounds.

I have not been graduated from primary school since the mathematics is too difficult to me.

I can not write very well.

I'm divorced seven years ago.

I once had two kids, but my ex-wife took both of them away, since I can't afford alimony.

## Profile

I'm working as a night shift doorman for [Cryptape Co., Ltd], since April, 2017, in [Hangzhou, China].

I have been engaged as a night shift doorman for more than twenty years.

I'm good at work as a night shift doorman.

**I am honest, and I never lie.**
