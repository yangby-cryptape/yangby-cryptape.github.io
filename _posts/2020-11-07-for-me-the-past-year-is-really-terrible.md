In the past few months, thinking about how would people think about my thoughts makes me be stressed.

No one put pressures on me, all pressures are coming from my inside.

These pressures make me feel uncomfortable, diffident, sad, disappointed, pointless and guilty.

As a solution to handle my negative emotions, I group all my tasks into two groups:
most of them are related to my job and the others are just my hobbies.

- For all tasks which are related to my job, I will share my opinions, but I would not insist on any of them.

  In most time, arguments bring nothing; they just make me feel tired.

  Making a decision quickly and trying it as soon as possible is more valuable.

- For all my personal tasks, I still will respect all suggestions and consider them seriously, but I will make the choices based on my own preferences.

  These tasks are created for happiness, confidence and satisfaction.
  And I spend my own part-time on them.

  I just want to be relaxed and do some creative things without being restricted.

  Why I have to compromise with other people's preferences?
